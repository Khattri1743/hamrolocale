    <h2>Shipping & Delivery Policy:</h2>
    <p>
      We at Hamrolocale understand the importance of reliable and efficient shipping when it comes to delivering food items.
      To ensure a seamless shopping experience for our customers, we have partnered with Bluedart, a premium logistics provider
      known for their reliability and quick delivery services.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Order Processing and Dispatch:</strong> Once you place an order on our website, it will be processed promptly.
      Our team will verify the order details and availability of the items. After order confirmation, we strive to dispatch
      the items within 2 to 4 business days.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Courier Consignment Number:</strong> Upon dispatch of your order, we will provide you with a unique courier
      consignment number. You can find this number in your user profile, which will allow you to track the progress of your
      shipment. This will enable you to monitor the location and estimated delivery date of your package.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Delivery Time-frame:</strong> With our partnership with Bluedart, we aim to deliver your items within 5 to 10
      business days from the date of dispatch. Please note that these delivery times are estimates and may vary depending on
      your location and unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. However, we will do our best to ensure that your package
      arrives as quickly as possible.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Shipping Restrictions:</strong> Please be aware that shipping restrictions may apply to certain locations due
      to legal or logistical reasons. In such cases, we will inform you at the time of order placement if we are unable to
      deliver to your specific address. We appreciate your understanding in such situations.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Packaging and Handling:</strong> To maintain the quality and freshness of our products, we take utmost care in
      packaging and handling. Your items will be securely packaged in food-grade materials, ensuring that they arrive in
      perfect condition.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Damaged or Missing Items:</strong> In the unlikely event that your order arrives damaged or with missing items,
      please contact our customer support team within 48 hours of receiving the package. We will initiate an investigation and
      work towards resolving the issue promptly.
    </p>
